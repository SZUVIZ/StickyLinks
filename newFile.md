# StickyLinks: A Novel Method for Visual Encoding of Graph Links.



StickyLinks introduces an **innovative approach** to visualize and encode quantitative data in graph links. Building upon the principles outlined in our research paper ["Sticky Links: Encoding Quantitative Data of Graph Links"](link-to-your-paper), this method **enhances the representation** of connections in graphical data, making it more **intuitive** and **informative** for users.

   we present __Sticky Links__, a novel visual encoding method that draws graph links with __stickiness__. Taking the metaphor of links with glues, sticky links represent connection strength using spiky shapes, ranging from two broken spikes for weak connections to connected lines for strong connections. 

## Dependencies

StickyLinks requires the following Python packages:

- **Python**: Version 3.9 or later (3.11 recommended).
- **Third-Party Libraries**:

  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `networkx`: To create and work with common graph layout algorithm.
  - `pycairo`: A set of Python bindings for the Cairo graphics library.

Install these packages using the following command:

```bash

pip install pandas networkx pycairo

```

## üíªUsage on Windows

### Installation

To install StickyLinks, open your command prompt and run:

```bash

pip install NodeStickyLinks

```

### Run StickyLinks

After installing StickyLinks via pip, you can easily integrate its graph drawing capabilities into your Python projects or run it interactively.

### Using StickyLinks in  Python Projects

If you're working on a Python project and want to use StickyLinks for graph visualization, you can import and use its functionalities as part of your code.

1. **Import the Package**: First, import the `drawsticky` module in your Python script:

   ```python

   from nodespikylink import drawsticky

   ```
2. **Utilize Drawing Functions**: Use the various functions provided by `drawsticky` to draw graphs and edges. Here's an example of how you might use some of these functions:

   ```python

   # Example usage

   data_path ="path/to/your/datafile.json"  # Replace with your data file path

   graph_data = drawsticky.readdata(data_path)

   node_positions = drawsticky.extract_node_positions(graph_data)

   # ... continue with other function calls as needed

   ```

   Replace the function calls in the example with the actual functions you need from the `drawsticky` module, based on your graph drawing requirements.

### Running StickyLinks Interactively

For an interactive experience, where you can input parameters and see results without writing much code, use the run_drawsticky script.

#### 1. Run the Interactive Script

Use Python to run the `run_drawsticky` module, which contains the interactive `run` function:

```python

  from nodespikylink import run_drawsticky


  run_drawsticky.run()

```

#### 2. Follow the Prompts

The script will prompt you for inputs such as the path to your data file and any other parameters required for drawing your graph. Enter these details as prompted to generate the graph visualization.

##### Link Style

- **Prompt**: Choose the style for graph links.
- **Input**: Type `stickiness` or `thickiness`. Please use lowercase letters.
- **Note**: This selection will define the visual appearance of the links in your graph.

##### Canvas Dimensions

- **Prompt**: Set the canvas size for your graph.
- **Input**: Provide width and height in numerical values (e.g.,600, 800, 1200).
- **Default Setting**: By default, the canvas is set to a rectangular shape.

##### Node Radius

- **Prompt**: Determine the radius size for nodes in your graph.
- **Input**: Enter a numerical value, preferably between 2 and 6.
- **Recommendation**: Based on our tests, a radius within this range should provide a balanced visual representation depending on your graph's scale.

##### Line Width

- **Prompt**: Set the width for the lines (edges) in your graph.
- **Input**: Enter a numerical value, ideally between 1 and 3.
- **Suggestion**: This value should be chosen in relation to your graph's scale; our testing suggests that values in this range are generally effective.

##### Graph Layout Selection

- **Prompt**: Choose a layout for organizing the graph.
- **Input Options**:

  - `0` for no specific layout.
  - `1` for `circular_layout`.
  - `2` for `random_layout`.
  - `3` for `shell_layout`.
  - `4` for `spring_layout`.
  - `5` for `spectral_layout`.
- **Note**: Each layout option offers a unique arrangement and perspective for your graph nodes.

After completing these inputs, StickyLinks will process your data and create a graph visualization based on your specified preferences.

### Output Formats

After completing the input prompts and processing your data, StickyLinks will generate the graph visualization. The results will be available in two formats:

- **SVG Format**: A scalable vector graphic file, ideal for high-quality, scalable visualizations and for further editing in vector graphic tools such as online editor boxy SVG.
- **PNG Format**: A portable network graphics file.

These files will be saved in the specified output directory or in a default location if not specified. You can use these files for presentations, reports, or further analysis.

## üìäExample of  Data

StickyLinks supports two graph data formats: JSON and CSV. Both formats are intended for undirected graphs.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£JSON Graph Format

In the JSON format, your data must include 'nodes' and 'links' fields:

- **Nodes**: Each node should have a 'name' and 'pos' (position) field. The 'pos' field must include 'x' and 'y' coordinates.
- **Links**: Links between nodes. If your graph includes weights, each link should have a 'weight' key.



**JSON1 Example**:

```json

{

    "nodes": [

        {"name": "Node1", "pos": {"x": 0, "y": 0}},

        {"name": "Node2", "pos": {"x": 1, "y": 1}},

        {"name": "Node3", "pos": {"x": 0, "y": 1}}

    ],

    "links": [

        {"source": "Node1", "target": "Node2", "weight": 1},

        {"source": "Node1", "target": "Node3", "weight": 0.2}

    ]

}

```

**JSON2 Example**:

```json

{

    "nodes": [

        {"name": "1", "pos": {"x": 0, "y": 0}},

        {"name": "2", "pos": {"x": 1, "y": 1}},

        {"name": "3", "pos": {"x": 0, "y": 1}}

    ],

    "links": [

        {"source": "1", "target": "2"},

        {"source": "1", "target": "3"}

    ]

}

```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ CSV Graph Format

StickyLinks also supports CSV formatted graphs. The CSV files should adhere to the following structure:

- **Delimiter**: Use ',' as the delimiter.
- **No Headers**: The CSV files should not contain headers.
- **Columns**: The first column is the source node id, the second column is the target node id, and the last column is the edge weight.
- **Encoding**: Files must be UTF-8 encoded.


**CSV1 Example**:

```

0 1 0.6

0 2 0.6

1 2 0.6


```

**CSV2 Example**:

```

0 1 0.3

0 2 0.8

1 2 0.5


```

Ensure that your data files conform to these formats for optimal compatibility with StickyLinks.
